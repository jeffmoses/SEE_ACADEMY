# 🎉 Fun Calculator 🎉

Welcome to **Fun Calculator!** This Python script lets you add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers with a dash of fun and style.

## 🚀 Features

- Accepts two numbers as input (including decimals!)
- Performs:
  - Addition ➕
  - Subtraction ➖
  - Multiplication ✖️
  - Division ➗ *(assuming you play nice and don’t divide by zero!)*
- Outputs the results in a friendly, easy-to-read format!

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. **Run the script**  
   Open your terminal and execute:  
   ```
   python fun_calculator.py
   ```
2. **Enter your first number**  
   Type any number (integers or decimals are welcome!) and press Enter.
3. **Enter your second number**  
   Type another number and press Enter.
4. **See the magic happen!**  
   Your results for sum, difference, product, and quotient appear instantly.

## 📋 Example

```

Enter the second number: 2
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 8.5
Difference: 4.5
Product: 13.0

## ⚠️ Note

- Division by zero isn’t handled in this version. Don’t try it, or you’ll cause a math explosion! 💥

## 🧑‍💻 How does it work?

It simply takes your inputs, turns them into floats (for decimal support), then does some basic math and prints out the results.

## 🎈 Have fun crunching numbers!
